# Create a dictionary. use {}
# Create a dictionary called bierce with keys
# day, positive and misfortune.
# Values are A period of twenty-four hours, mostly misspent
# Mistaken at the top of one's voice
# The kind of fortune that never misses

# convert arrays to a dictionary using dict() using tuples or in array of arrays.
# Create the above dictionary  using the dict()
# Create another using pairs a, b  & c,d & e, f

# Accessing items by key.
# Create tuples a, b & c, d & e ,f
# Create a dictionary using dict() function.

# Get an item by [key] or with get()
# Creat a dictionary using {} as follows.
# 'Chapman' => Graham.
# Cleese => John.
# Idle => Eric
# Jones => Terry.
# Plain => Michael.
# Add another item with [] operator. Gillaim to Gerry


# Get all keys with keys()
# Print the keys from above dictionary.

# Get all values with values()
# Prin the items with values function.

# Get all key value pairs with items()
# Display all the key value pairs with items() function.

# Combining Dictionaries with update()
# Declare the Chapman dictoryar above and combine it wht others
# others dictionary as folows Marx => Groucho Howard => Moe.

# Purely delete an item with del
# Form the above dicitionary deilete Marx entry with del.

# Get an item by key and delete with pop()
# Delete and collect the value using pop()


# Delete all items with clear()
# USe clear() to clear the entire dictionary

# Test for key with in operator.
# Chapman => Graham, Cleese => John, Jones => Terry, Palin => Michael, Idle =< Eric.
# use in operator to test if Chapman is in pythong and if Palin is in Pythons

# Assing with =
# Declare signals as green => go, yellow => Go faster, red => Smile for the camera.
# Assign signals to save_signals.

# Shallow copy with copy .
# make a copy of the signals using copy. Change one of the value. and verify it
# is changed at both places.



# Deep copy with deepcopy()
# declare signals as follows.
# green => go, yellow => go Faster red => stop smile
# make a deep copy of the signals and change the one of the values.
# then print out.

# Declare dictionary as follows.
# accusatoin as
# room => Ballroom, weapon => Lead Pipe, Person => Col. Mustard.
# Iterate on keys for above dictionary

# Iterate on values for above dictionary

# Iterate on items for above dictionary. items() returns key, value pairs.

# Create a dictionary using Dictionary Comprehensions .
# declare a string word as "letters".
# Get the letters_count hash key is each letter and number of ocurences of the letter in word.
# This is great.

# Do the same above by converting to set. This will prevent iterating twice.

#  Declare vowes as aeiou
# Declare word as onomatopoeia
# Create a set called vowel_counts. Find a count of character with vowel counts on above

# Delete an item with remove()

# Create with set()

# Convert with set()
# created word called letters and use set and print it.
# COnvert the list 'Dasher', 'Dancer', 'Prancer', 'Mason-Dixon'
# to a set.

# Get length with len() function
# Create a list called 'Dasher', 'Dancer', 'Prancer', 'Mason-Dixon'
# Covner the list to a set and  find the lenght

# Add an item with add() function.
# Dcleare a set as 1, 2 , 3
# Add 4 to the above set.

# Delete an item with remove() function.
# remove 3 from the above set.

# Test for a value with in
# Declare the set as sofa, ottoman and table. use for in to print the above set.

# Complex sets.
# declare drinks as foloows.
# martini => vodka and vermounth
# black russian => vodka and kahlua.
# white russian => cream, kahula and vodka
# ' manhattan' => rye, vermounth and bitters
# secreweddriver as orange juice and vodka

# Iterate with name (key) and contents (values )
# on the above dictorialyr. if vodka is in the contents, print hthe vlaues.

# Combinations and Operators.
# For the above find intersection of contents with {"vermouth", "orange juice"}
# if there is itnersection print th anem.

# NEx tiem if there not intersection with {"vermouth", "orange juice"} print the name.

# Set intersection with & . Example a = {1,2} and b = {2,3}
# a & b will lead 2. or a.intersection(b)


# a = {1,2} and b = {2,3} a union b or a | b is {1,2,3}

# difference() function. a - b or a.difference(b)

# a is subset of b. a.issubset(b)

# a is superset of b. a.issupserst(b)

# Set Comprehensions.
# { expression for expression in iterable }
# { expression for expression in iterable if condition }

# Immutable sets.

# Big sets
# Declare marxes as 'Groucho', 'Chico', 'Harpo'
# Declare pythons as 'Chapman', 'Cleese', 'Gilliam', 'Jones', 'Palin'
# Declare stooges as 'Moe', 'Curly', 'Larry'

# Gernerate the tuple form the above listsa and pritn them.

# From the above lists create list of lists.

# Delcare a dictionary as follows.
# Marxes => marxes, Pythons => pythons and Stooges as stooges
